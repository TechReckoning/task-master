- **Visual Metaphors**: Cards and lists representing organized workspaces
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes content and usability

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent highlights

- **Secondary Colors**: Soft grays for backgrounds and muted content

- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys stability and focus, amber provides warmth and achievement
- **Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios throughout

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varying weights
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body text, and UI elements
- **Font Personality**: Modern, readable, and professional
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line height and spacing for scanning task lists
- **Which fonts**: Inter - excellent for UI and task text legibility
- **Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent readability at all sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Statistics cards draw initial attention, then task input, then task list
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between elements to reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Responsive card-based layout with consistent spacing
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up elegantly
- **Content Density**: Balanced information display without overwhelming users

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Micro-interactions communicate state changes and provide feedback
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Task addition, completion, and drag-and-drop have distinct animations
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Shadcn components for consistency - Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Badges, Tabs
- **Component Customization**: Tailwind utilities for spacing and color theming
- **Component States**: Clear hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent visual language
- **Drag Handle**: Six-dot vertical grip icon for intuitive drag interaction
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly sizing and gestures

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- **Library Choice**: @dnd-kit for accessible, keyboard-navigable drag-and-drop
- **Visual Feedback**: Tasks lift and rotate slightly when dragged
- **Activation Distance**: 8px movement required to prevent accidental drags
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation for accessibility
- **Touch Support**: Optimized for mobile touch interactions

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no tasks exist or filters return no results
- **Category Deletion**: Tasks maintain data integrity when categories are removed
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tasks without order field are automatically migrated
- **Drag Boundaries**: Drag-and-drop only works within the current filtered view

## Implementation Considerations
- **Data Migration**: Automatic order field addition for existing tasks
- **Performance**: Efficient re-rendering during drag operations
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **State Management**: Proper functional updates to prevent stale closure issues

## Reflection
This approach creates a task management tool that feels natural and responds immediately to user input, with drag-and-drop adding an intuitive way to prioritize and organize tasks within any filtered view.
