## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Calm, organized, and productive feeling with clear priority awareness
- **Design Personality**: Clean, modern, and minimalist with priority-driven visual hierarchy
- **Visual Metaphors**: Cards and lists representing organized workspaces with traffic-light priority system
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes content and usability while maintaining priority clarity

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic base with priority-specific accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - trustworthy and professional
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft grays for backgrounds and muted content
- **Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - highlighting completed tasks and success states
- **Priority Colors**: 
  - High: Red tones for urgency and attention
  - Medium: Yellow/amber tones for balanced priority
  - Low: Green tones for calm, non-urgent tasks
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys stability and focus, priority colors follow universal traffic-light patterns
- **Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios throughout including priority indicators

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varying weights
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body text, priority labels, and UI elements
- **Font Personality**: Modern, readable, and professional
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line height and spacing for scanning task lists with priority badges
- **Which fonts**: Inter - excellent for UI and task text legibility
- **Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent readability at all sizes including small priority labels

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Priority indicators draw immediate attention, then statistics cards, task input, then task list
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between elements to reduce cognitive load while accommodating priority badges
- **Grid System**: Responsive card-based layout with consistent spacing, enhanced statistics grid
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up elegantly with priority indicators
- **Content Density**: Balanced information display including priority without overwhelming users

### Priority Visual System
- **Color Dots**: Consistent 8px colored dots for quick priority scanning
- **Icon Consistency**: Warning (high), Minus (medium), Check (low) for semantic clarity
- **Border Accents**: Left border highlight for high-priority tasks
- **Badge System**: Outlined badges with priority-specific colors
- **Hierarchy**: Priority indicators positioned prominently but not overwhelmingly

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Micro-interactions communicate state changes, priority updates, and provide feedback
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Task addition, completion, priority changes, and drag-and-drop have distinct animations
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract from priority assessment

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Shadcn components for consistency - Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Badges, Tabs, Select
- **Component Customization**: Tailwind utilities for spacing, priority colors, and theming
- **Component States**: Clear hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements including priority selectors
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent visual language including priority indicators
- **Priority Selection**: Dropdown selector in task creation form with clear priority options
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly sizing and gestures for priority selection

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- **Library Choice**: @dnd-kit for accessible, keyboard-navigable drag-and-drop
- **Visual Feedback**: Tasks lift and rotate slightly when dragged, maintaining priority indicators
- **Activation Distance**: 8px movement required to prevent accidental drags
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation for accessibility
- **Touch Support**: Optimized for mobile touch interactions
- **Priority Preservation**: Drag operations maintain priority-based sorting

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no tasks exist or filters return no results
- **Category Deletion**: Tasks maintain data integrity when categories are removed
- **Priority Migration**: Existing tasks without priority field default to "medium"
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tasks automatically receive default priority and order fields
- **Drag Boundaries**: Drag-and-drop respects priority-based sorting within filtered views

## Implementation Considerations
- **Data Migration**: Automatic priority field addition for existing tasks (defaulting to "medium")
- **Performance**: Efficient re-rendering during drag operations and priority filtering
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for priority levels and keyboard navigation
- **State Management**: Proper functional updates to prevent stale closure issues
- **Priority Consistency**: Maintain visual priority language across all components

## Reflection
This enhanced approach creates a task management tool that not only feels natural and responds immediately to user input, but also provides clear priority awareness helping users focus on what matters most. The three-tier priority system with intuitive visual indicators allows for better task organization while maintaining the clean, minimalist design philosophy.
